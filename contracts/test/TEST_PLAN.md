# LAF Comprehensive Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing for the LAF (Lost and Found) system based on the cycle diagram. The system involves multiple actors, states, and complex cryptographic verification mechanisms.

## System Actors
1. **Owner** - Registers items, reports lost, confirms returns
2. **Finder** - Discovers lost items, provides proof of possession
3. **Community** - Supports items with rewards, votes on disputes
4. **Contract System** - Manages state transitions, verifications, rewards

## State Transitions & Test Categories

### 1. REGISTRATION PHASE
**States**: Unregistered → Registered

#### Positive Test Cases:

#### Negative Test Cases:
- ❌ Registration with duplicate secret hash
- ❌ Registration with invalid secret hash format
- ❌ Registration with empty/invalid comment
- ❌ Registration by unauthorized address

#### Edge Cases:
- 🔄 Registration during network congestion
- 🔄 Registration with maximum comment length

### 4. FOUND REPORTING PHASE
**States**: Lost → Found

#### Positive Test Cases:
- ✅ Valid finder reports item found

- ✅ Automatic reward distribution

#### Negative Test Cases:
- ❌ Invalid secret signature
- ❌ Forged owner signature
- ❌ Forged finder signature
- ❌ Report non-lost item as found
- ❌ Double-claim attempts

#### Edge Cases:
- 🔄 Found reporting with smart wallet signatures
- 🔄 Found reporting during cooldown
- 🔄 Signature verification edge cases
- 🔄 ERC-1271 signature validation failures

### 5. CRYPTOGRAPHIC VERIFICATION
**Critical Security Tests**

#### Signature Verification Tests:

#### Security Attack Tests:
- ❌ Signature forgery attempts
- ❌ Replay attack attempts
- ❌ Frontrunning attack simulations
- ❌ Secret brute force attempts

### 6. RETURN CONFIRMATION PHASE
**States**: Found → Returned

#### Positive Test Cases:
- ✅ Owner confirms item return
- ✅ Reward distribution to finder
- ✅ Charity fee distribution
- ✅ Platform fee distribution

#### Negative Test Cases:
- ❌ Non-owner attempts return confirmation
- ❌ Confirm return of non-found item
- ❌ Double return confirmation

#### Edge Cases:
- 🔄 Return during cooldown period
- 🔄 Return with insufficient contract balance
- 🔄 Return with failed token transfers

### 7. NON-RETURN SCENARIOS
**States**: Found → Lost (penalty applied)

#### Positive Test Cases:
- ✅ Owner initiates non-return after cooldown
- ✅ Community initiates non-return after extended period
- ✅ Penalty application to finder
- ✅ Reward redistribution to charity

#### Negative Test Cases:
- ❌ Non-return before cooldown expires
- ❌ Unauthorized non-return initiation
- ❌ Non-return on already returned item

#### Edge Cases:
- 🔄 Non-return timing edge cases
- 🔄 Penalty calculation edge cases
- 🔄 Multiple non-return attempts

### 8. WITHDRAWAL & REVOCATION
**States**: Various → Withdrawn/Revoked

#### Positive Test Cases:
- ✅ Owner withdraws from returned item
- ✅ Owner revokes lost item after cooldown
- ✅ Proper balance transfers

#### Negative Test Cases:
- ❌ Withdraw from non-returned item
- ❌ Revoke before cooldown
- ❌ Unauthorized withdrawal/revocation

### 9. INTEGRATION & SYSTEM TESTS

#### Frontend Integration:
- ✅ QR code generation and scanning
- ✅ Wallet connection (EOA & Smart Wallets)
- ✅ Transaction signing flows
- ✅ XMTP messaging integration
- ✅ Mobile responsiveness

#### Backend Integration:
- ✅ Subgraph event indexing
- ✅ GraphQL query accuracy
- ✅ Real-time updates
- ✅ Error handling and recovery

#### Performance Tests:
- ✅ Gas optimization verification
- ✅ Large-scale transaction handling
- ✅ Concurrent user interactions
- ✅ Network congestion scenarios

## Test Implementation Strategy
